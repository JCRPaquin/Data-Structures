# Data Structures
## A collection of data structure implementations for learning purposes
----

Language: C++
Testing rig: [Catch](http://catch-lib.net/)
Build system: [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

The goal is to implement non-primitive data structures from the [Wikipedia Data Structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures) page.

Each data structure gets:
- A high level description
- Example use cases
- Comparisons (or links) to related structures
- Test cases!

The categories are as follows:
- [ ] Primitives
    + [ ] Strings
        * [ ] Rope
        * [ ] Trie
- [ ] Abstract Data Types
    + [ ] Maps
        * [ ] Associative arrays
        * [ ] Hash maps
        * [ ] Tree maps
    + [ ] Multimap
    + [ ] Set
        * [ ] Hash sets
        * [ ] Tree sets
    + [ ] Multiset *(Bags)*
    + [ ] Stacks
    + [ ] Queues
        * [ ] Double-ended Queues
        * [ ] Priority Queues
- [ ] Linear Data Structures
    + [ ] Lists
        * [ ] Doubly-linked
            - [ ] XOR based
        * [ ] Array
        * [ ] Linked
        * [ ] Self-organizing
            - [ ] With a runtime analysis!
        * [ ] Skip
        * [ ] Unrolled
        * [ ] :warning: Double-connected edge
    + [ ] Arrays
        * [ ] Circular buffer
        * [ ] Gap buffer
- [ ] Trees
    + [ ] AA
    + [ ] AVL
    + [ ] Red-Black
    + [ ] Splay
    + [ ] Binary search
    + [ ] Treap *also known as **Cartesian***
    + [ ] Randomized binary search
    + [ ] Quadtree
    + [ ] Range
    + [ ] Disjoint-set
- [ ] Graphs
    + [ ] Adjacency list
    + [ ] Adjacency matrix
    + [ ] Incidence matrix
    + [ ] :warning: Sparse matrix representations
